I am Jian Xu. I received my Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics and Electronic Information from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in December 2025, under the supervision of Professor Delu Zeng. I am currently a postdoc researcher  at the RIKEN iTMEMS & AIP in Japan, supervised by Professor Qibin Zhao.

My research lies at the intersection of probabilistic machine learning, stochastic processes, generative modeling, differential equation–based methods, and Quantum Machine Learning. I aim to integrate advanced mathematical tools with modern machine learning, with a particular focus on Bayesian generative models and principled inference, including Gaussian processes, variational inference, and diffusion models.

During my postdoctoral research, I primarily work on projects related to Quantum Machine Learning. This project is jointly led by RIKEN iTMEMS and RIKEN AIP, with the goal of promoting the application of quantum methods in machine learning.

My first-author work has appeared in ICML (Oral, Top 1%), ICLR, AAAI, AISTATS, TNNLS, and KBS. Several manuscripts are currently under review. I also collaborate closely with Professor John Paisley (Columbia University) on Bayesian machine learning and variational inference.
