I am **Jian Xu**, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in *Computational Mathematics and Electronic Information* at **South China University of Technology (SCUT)**, advised by **Professor Delu Zeng**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **probabilistic machine learning**, **stochastic processes**, **generative models**, **differential equations**, and **large language models**.

I aim to integrate advanced mathematical tools with machine learning, focusing primarily on generative models and Bayesian methods such as Gaussian processes, to build principled and efficient inference frameworks. I have published multiple first-author papers in top-tier venues including **ICML (Oral, Top 1%)**, **AAAI**, **IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)**, **Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS)**, and **AISTATS**. Several other works are currently under review at prestigious conferences and journals such as **NeurIPS** and **TPAMI**.
