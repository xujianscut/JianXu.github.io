I am Jian Xu. I received my Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics and Electronic Information from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in December 2025, under the supervision of Professor Delu Zeng. I am currently a research intern at the RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) in Japan, supervised by Professor Qibin Zhao.

My research lies at the intersection of probabilistic machine learning, stochastic processes, generative modeling, differential equation-based methods, and large language models. I aim to integrate advanced mathematical tools with modern machine learning, with a focus on Bayesian generative models and principled inference, including Gaussian processes and variational inference.

My first-author work has appeared in ICML (Oral, Top 1%), AAAI, AISTATS, TNNLS, and KBS. Several manuscripts are currently under review. I also collaborate closely with Professor John Paisley (Columbia University) on Bayesian machine learning and variational inference.
